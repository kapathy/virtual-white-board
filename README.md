### `justification of technology`

I choose to use the technologies I have experience with. Therefore I ended up using React and Firebase (for authentication). I think both of these are great tools for an office tool like this, that doesn't require any strictly advanced technology. Firebase is also a great for further extending the application in relation to data persistence. I actually already set up the collection, but I did not have time to finish implementing it. However, using React and Firebase, there a many possibilities for extending the application, for example making a mobile version, so users can post from their phones. 

I focused on full-stack because I really enjoy the frontend of programming, however, in the future I really want to learn more about the backend, which is why I spent a lot of time looking into how I could use firebase.
